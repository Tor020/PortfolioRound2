<h2 class="section-heading">About</h2>
<div>
<p>At time of writing in 2017, I'm a 26 year old self taught Web
developer whose been using the Internet since the late 90s. I've
always thought the Internet was pretty awesome, and figuring out
how things work has always been something I've enjoyed doing.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>I find Web development to be really engaging and fun for me
personally because it feels like there's great practical
application to all the new things I learn. For instance, I loved
learning how to make the Pong demo because when I started with Web
development, I had no idea that making games via HTML5 and
Javascript was even possible. It was really exciting for me to see
that I could utilize the canvas and Javascript to make something
like that. It was just really cool for me.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>As far as short term goals, I'm really dedicated to
understanding Javascript and working to be able to utilize it to
its full potential. This includes things like learning the nuances
of modern Javascript frameworks. I have long term aspirations of
becoming a fullstack developer.</p>

<p>A value i find important is trying your best when doing things.
In a sense, I look at trying my best as a goal for anything. I
think that having that initial goal in your mind helps give you a
frame of reference for what you are trying to do with all things.
This type of thinking is important because of the real world
implications it would have. This is one of those things that
probably sounds good in theory but if you stop to consider the idea
you might see a problem, which is we are all humans not machines,
perfection is unattainable and people have lives. Sometimes people
have problems at home, sometimes people are distracted from the
task at hand. Shit, sometimes it's just more fun to not care and do
the task in some other way. The way i feel about this is that
trying your best is just an extremely good framework to deal with
anything. You don't go into a task and size up the situation and
think about deadlines etc. What you always want to do is be able to
walk away from a situation knowing that you did everything you
could given what you knew and understood at the time. Transparency
is vital. Try to imagine what the world would be like if everyone
tried their best all the time. Depending on your outlook on the
world mileage may vary. For me personally though, I think people
are for the most part good. I think that if everyone tried their
best at things they did that the world would be a better place for
everyone. This is the type of perspective I strive to live
with.</p>
<p>The world is very complicated. It's hard to boil down any one
person's ideology to a few words to represent themselves, but I've
thought about this type of thing quite a lot.</p>
<p>Being practical, Trying my best</p>
