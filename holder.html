              A value i find important is trying your best when doing things. In a sense, I look at trying my best as a goal for anything.
              I think that having that initial goal in your mind helps give you a frame of reference for what you are trying
              to do with all things. This type of thinking is important because of the real world implications it would have.
              This is one of those things that probably sounds good in theory but if you stop to consider the idea you might
              see a problem, which is we are all humans not machines, perfection is unattainable and people have lives. Sometimes
              people have problems at home, sometimes people are distracted from the task at hand. Shit, sometimes it's just
              more fun to not care and do the task in some other way. The way i feel about this is that trying your best
              is just an extremely good framework to deal with anything. You don't go into a task and size up the situation
              and think about deadlines etc. What you always want to do is be able to walk away from a situation knowing
              that you did everything you could given what you knew and understood at the time. Transparency is vital. Try
              to imagine what the world would be like if everyone tried their best all the time. Depending on your outlook
              on the world mileage may vary. For me personally though, I think people are for the most part good. I think
              that if everyone tried their best at things they did that the world would be a better place for everyone. This
              is the type of perspective I strive to live with.

              <p>The world is very complicated. It's hard to boil down any one person's ideology to a few words to represent
                themselves, but I've thought about this type of thing quite a lot.</p>

          <p>At time of writing in 2017, I'm a 26 year old self taught Web Developer whose been using the Internet since the
            late 90s. I've always thought the Internet was pretty awesome, but I especially like the practical application it brings to everyone.</p>

          <p> The first web application I made and put on github for use is called the <a href="https://tor020.github.io/Killing-Floor-2-Calculator/">KF2calc</a> which was made to help players to calculate their damage in an online video game. Damage calculations weren't displayed anywhere in-game or online and you'd have to look up formulas on the Internet and plug them into a calculator for each weapon. After doing it myself a few times I thought that it'd be pretty useful to have an application that did this for me. So I went to building the website. I launched the website last year and have implemented additional features after communicating with the userbase on social media. Since then, I've monetized the website with Ad Sense and have daily usage confirmed by Google Analytics. Throughout this project's lifetime I've tried to practice Agile and Waterfall software development methodologies. </p>


          <p> I'm really dedicated to mastering Javascript and working to be able to utilize
            it to its full potential. This includes things like learning the nuances of modern Javascript frameworks. From there I want to branch out into backend languages like python and php
            and eventually become a fullstack developer.</p>
